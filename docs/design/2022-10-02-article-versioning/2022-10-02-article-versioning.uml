note right of articles
    Each article has a stable identity, but its contents can
    change over time. This is similar to a Git Repo.
end note

entity "article_branches" {
    id:         number <<generated>>
    article_id: number FK
    --
    published_at: timestamp
    branch_name:  varchar
    created_at:   timestamp
    modified_at:  timestamp
}

note right of article_branches
    Each article can have multiple branches which have different
    versions of the content. This is similar to a Git branch.

    This will allow users to branch off of an article and make
    some exploratory/speculative edits without changing the
    published content. However, in contrast to Git, this persistence
    strategy won't attempt to implement branch merging.

    Branches can be published, which makes the most recent commit on
    the branch available online.
end note

entity "article_versions" {
    id:        number <<generated>>
    branch_id: number FK
    --
    title:       varchar
    content:     varchar
    created_at:  timestamp
    modified_at: timestamp
}

note right of article_versions
    Each article_branch can have a series of "commits" that are
    different versions of that branch. When a branch is published,
    only the most recent version will be visible online.
    This is similar to a Git commit.
