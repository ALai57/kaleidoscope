note right of articles
    Each article has a stable identity, but its contents can
    change over time. This is similar to a Github Repo.

entity "article_branches" {
    id: number <<generated>>
    --
    archived:    boolean
    branch_name: varchar
    modified_at: timestamp
    created_at:  timestamp
}

note right of article_branches
    Each article can have multiple branches which have different
    versions of the content. This is similar to a Github branch.

    This will allow users to branch off of an article and make
    some exploratory/speculative edits without changing the
    published content. However, in contrast to Git, this persistence
    strategy won't attempt to implement branch merging.

    Branches can be "archived", indicating that they are no longer
    considered useful. This is like a soft delete.

entity "article_versions" {

    --
    title:       varchar
    content:     varchar
    modified_at: timestamp
    created_at:  timestamp
}

note right of article_versions
    Each article_branch can have a series of "commits"
    that are different versions of that branch.
    This is similar to the Github concept of a commit on a branch
